# Just-On-Time

Over the years, the US airline industry has been striving for improvements in service quality; some airlines were more successful than the others. Given an increasingly globalized world we are living in, air travel will continue to grow, faster than ever. Keeping airline companies competitive is thus a worthwhile cause, for it is undesirable to keep inefficient businesses that offer poor services and result in wastage of time and resources.

In this project, our team will make use of data visualization techniques to help scrutinize problems in United States airline industry. One key problem that plagues the US airline industry for decades is that of flight delays. To enhance the industry overall service quality, we decided to investigate the flight delay situation in US.
